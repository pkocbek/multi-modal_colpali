Similarly, FGC20 expression significantly varied, particularly elevated in Established CD subjects (p = 0.0066, panel b). IL-1β and IL-6 levels showed notable elevations in the Established CD cohort (p = 0.0044 and p = 0.0002 respectively, panels e and f), while TNF levels remained similarly elevated across groups (panel h, p = 0.0010). In contrast, IL-10 analysis revealed no significant differences among cohorts (panel i).\\n\\nAnti-IgG responses, visualized through ECA analysis (panel j), indicated significant disparities in pixel density across groups, particularly between HC and Established CD (p = 0.0002). CD86 also exhibited marked differences in normalized MFI following various treatments (panel k, p = 0.0037 and p = 0.0229). \\n\\nFurther exploration of activated macrophage markers indicated no significant deviations when exposed to different stimuli (mannan and di-GlcNAc, panels l and m). Overall, these results suggest a complex modulation of immune parameters in CD patients, particularly under established disease conditions, emphasizing the need for tailored therapeutic strategies. \\n\\nKeywords: CD86, FGC20, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF, anti-IgG, established CD, immunological response.', 'The input provided is a figure.\\n\\nKey findings indicate differential expression profiles among groups: Pred_6y, Healthy Control (HC), and Pred_Dx. Heatmap visualization reveals significant z-score variations in gene expression across 34 identified genes related to immune signaling pathways (e.g., TNF, NF-κB, NOD-like receptor signaling) (Panel a). Pathway analysis highlights the adjusted p-values and gene ratios, demonstrating notable enrichment in the aforementioned pathways (Panel b). Volcano plot analysis (Panel c) identifies critical genes with fold changes and significant p-values, such as CCL20 and IL-6, crucial for inflammation and immune responses.\\n\\nSurface receptor expression was measured using flow cytometry. DC-SIGN levels show significant differences between groups, particularly lower in Pred_Dx and Established CD (normalized MFI: 0.0015 for HC vs. Pred_Dx; 0.0001 for HC vs. Established CD) (Panel d). Decitin-2 similarly exhibits significant reductions in Pred_Dx compared to HC (p=0.0050) (Panel e). Molecular expression analysis indicates an upward trend in MLACL genes across groups (p=0.291) but with minimal significance. However, CACADP expression is significantly lower in Pred_Dx compared to HC (p=0.0088) (Panels g and h). \\n\\nWestern blot analysis reveals phospho-NF-κB levels, suggesting dysregulation in Pred_Dx compared to HC (normalized density: p=0.0393) (Panel f). These findings underscore altered immune signaling pathways in disease progression and potential therapeutic targets.']\n",
      "['Input Type: Figure.\\n\\nThis figure depicts a stylized, circular emblem. A central red rectangular shape is overlaid by a ring comprised of three concentric bands: a blue outer ring, a yellow inner ring, and a green band positioned between them. The design evokes symbolism potentially related to national flags or organizational branding, but lacks specific contextual data for precise interpretation. Visual analysis indicates a focus on color contrast and geometric form, with the red rectangle serving as a focal point. The arrangement suggests layers or divisions, potentially representing distinct components or affiliations. Due to the abstract nature of the image and lack of accompanying information, a definitive functional or representational meaning cannot be determined.', 'IgG subclass distribution and temporal dynamics are analyzed in relation to COVID-19 severity. Dot plots depict the odds ratio for increased abundance of specific IgG subclasses (IgG1-4, HSN4F1, HSN5F1) at different time points post-diagnosis (Dx) – up to 6 years – compared to baseline. Significant increases are observed for several subclasses, with p-values indicating statistical significance (P < 0.00001 to P < 0.05). \\n\\nComplication probability demonstrates a negative correlation with days post-diagnosis, particularly for high abundance strata (Spearman’s ρ = -0.75, P < 0.00097). Heatmaps reveal correlations between IgG subclass abundance over time; IgG1 HSN4F1 and IgG2 HSN4F1 display strong positive correlations (ρ > 0.5) at early time points, transitioning to negative correlations (ρ < -0.5) at later time points. \\n\\nA composite antibody-reactivity heatmap highlights differential reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S, N, M, E, ORF3a) across time points, with changes in antibody profiles correlating with disease progression. Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals distinct clustering based on antibody reactivity profiles, exhibiting temporal shifts in antibody landscapes following COVID-19 diagnosis.', 'Figure displaying cytokine and marker expression in healthy controls (HC), predicted drug responders (Pred. Dx), and established disease (Established Dx) groups, with and without IgG blockade (w/o IgG). CD96 expression (MFI) is significantly reduced in Pred. Dx and Established Dx compared to HC (p<0.0001). HC24 expression (relative ER) shows a similar trend (p<0.0001). IgG blockade further reduces CD96 in Pred. Dx and Established Dx. IL-6 levels (pg mL⁻¹) are elevated in Pred. Dx and Established Dx versus HC (p<0.0001), and IgG blockade significantly decreases IL-6 in these groups (p<0.0001). IL-8 (pg mL⁻¹) and IL-10 (pg mL⁻¹) also demonstrate increased levels in disease states, with varying responses to IgG blockade (IL-8 p<0.0001; IL-10 p<0.0001). TNF-α (pg mL⁻¹) is significantly increased in Established Dx (p<0.0001). Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels (ng mL⁻¹) are higher in Pred. Dx and Established Dx (p<0.0001), reduced with IgG blockade. Normalized eosinophil count/area shows similar changes. CD66 (MFI) is elevated in Pred. Dx and Established Dx and is reduced by IgG blockade (p<0.0001). Data presented as violin plots with statistical significance indicated.', 'Analysis of gene expression reveals pathway-specific alterations in a NOD-like receptor signaling context. Pred_6y, compared to HC (Healthy Control), demonstrates significant changes in TNF signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, and C-type lectin receptor signaling. Heatmaps display Z-score deviations, highlighting upregulation of genes like *CCL2*, *IL1B*, and *CXCL8* within the TNF signaling pathway (Pred_6y Z-score range: -2 to 2). Volcano plots show differential gene expression with adjusted p-values and log2 fold changes; 20 genes are significantly altered (adjusted p < 0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis identifies CTQA, CLECTOA, and SOCS3 as key differentially expressed genes. DC-SIGN (Dendritic Cell-Specific ICAM-3 Grabbing Non-integrin) normalized mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) is reduced in Pred_6y compared to HC (p < 0.001). Decline-2 normalized MFI also shows a reduction in Pred_6y (p < 0.0005). Phospho-NF-kB normalized MFI exhibits a trend toward reduction, though not statistically significant (p = 0.0393).  Finally, NLRC4 expression is increased in Pred_6y compared to HC and Established CD (p < 0.001), while CARD9 expression shows a trend towards increase in Pred_6y (p = 0.0088).']\n",
